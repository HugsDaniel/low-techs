# The LowTech DataScience Project

The LowTech DataScience Project (name to be found) is an initiative by a group of engineers to enhance R&D on low-tech systems.
Low-techs are defined as followed by the [Low Tech Lab](https://lowtechlab.org/)

>"Low-tech" are technologies, services and know-how that meet the following criteria:
>
>**Useful**
>A low-tech meets essential needs in the fields of energy, food, water, waste management, construction materials, housing, transport, hygiene or health.
>
>**Sustainable**
>Robust, repairable, recyclable, it is designed to ensure that its ecological and social impact is optimal from production, distribution, use until the end of its life.
>
>**Accessible**
>Unlike high-tech, its cost and technical complexity are not prohibitive for a large part of the population.

We strongly believe that sobriety and sustainable innovation, the very fields in which low-techs take place,  will be the keys to the future of our civilization.

Having worked several years in this field, we found that there is a cruel lack of R&D being done on this subject, although low-techs are heavily built all around the world and used by millions.

We also found that the internet is filled with people building innovative low-techs (even if they don't call them low-techs), and sharing their results in numerous platforms. Unfortunately, there is few to no aggregation of all this data, and this task only would require a full-time commitment.

So, how can we take advantage of this available knowledge ? That's why we're here.


## PROJECT

The goal of this project is to enhance research and development around low-tech systems using computer science. Why computer science ? Because it's both our line of work and a very powerful tool to analyze data that would take weeks and full-time commitment for a human to make.

We want to provide report templates to makers on the internet that contain numerous measurement points on the developed system itself and around its making process. It should be generic enough to suit every possible development condition.

Analyzing the gathered data using computer science will help define patterns according to multiple criteria:

 - [WHERE] Geographic, social and political environment surrounding the making of the low-tech
 - [WHAT]  Technology developed and measured performances
 - [HOW]   Tools, materials and energy used to make the low-tech
 - [WHO]   Human skills and knowledge
 - [WHY]   Actual human motivation to build the low-tech

Two kinds of results can be expected from the analysis :

 - Generic patterns that work in a wide variety of conditions
 - Specific patterns that work in particular conditions

Both kinds will improve drastically our insights on the development of these technologies. The consequences could vary from better documentation for local development to material for the creation of business models around the making of low-techs.


## DATA AGGREGATION

Several forums exist that enable people to share their maker experiences, such as [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
The idea is to first take advantage of these platforms by encouraging makers to take some time to fill out a report when they build something.

This way we don't need to build an actual community around our own project, but rather consider that every maker has his/her own motivation and just builds interesting stuff that we can exploit.
We believe it will enable us to put the focus on the technologies rather than the reason they exist.

So, as a first step, we will be sharing the report template on these forums, hoping that members of the existing community fill them out, at least partially with data they already have. This first step will also help us to estimate the amount of data we can gather.


## TRANSPARENCY

Every piece of data about the low-tech itself and/or information about the maker that we collect will be treated anonymously and will never be used for any commercial purpose. We will be as transparent as humanly possible on every step of the process, from the project scoping to the publishing of the results.

A part of our analysis will apply on data about the actual maker, so we reserve our right to withold personal informations on the person. The rest of the data will be published.

The whole analysis algorithm will be public and available on Github under open source licence.


## PROJECT MANAGEMENT

There are three first steps:

### Step 0

Step 0 is basically bench-marking. We want to estimate the amount of active makers, the country they're in, the media they chose to share their discoveries, the technologies that are the most developed, even the makers will to take part of our study. 

Basically, we want to start interacting with this decentralized community and see if our project is just a utopia or if there's actual material to work with.

### Step 1
Step 1 is choosing a first low-tech to study. We are looking over the internet to find a technology that is heavily developed, in various parts of the world, possibly with a lot of variants, and also that provide precise mesuring points. A good first candidate would be the [wind turbine](https://github.com/HugsDaniel/low-techs/blob/master/wind-turbine.md).

When we have the system, we can define a report template to share on forums.

### Step 2
Step 2 is using the report template to develop the actual analysis algorithm. A first phase of tests will occur with made-up data to determine the algorithm's abilities.


## CONTRIBUTING

Note that this is done on our free time, so any help in any way is more than welcome !
For now, if you want to contribute or just talk with us, please send an email to lowtechweb@protonmail.com.

You can find the project on GitHub. This is the place where the code will be shared. We still have to decide where we will share the data and results.
